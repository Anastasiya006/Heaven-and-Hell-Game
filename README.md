## Overview
A single player, 2D-platformer made with Python and pygame. The game’s objective is simple: collect all the diamonds to proceed to the next level, but beware of the opposing gravities between the two characters! Unlike most platformer games, Heaven and Hell is a game where both characters are controlled using the same keys; as a result, this poses a challenging twist on classic platformer games.

## Mechanics
 Key         | Action                                      |

| **Space**  | Single or double jump to avoid obstacles    |
| **←  →**   | Move left or right to navigate characters   |
