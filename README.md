## Overview
A single player, 2D-platformer made with Python and pygame. The gameâ€™s objective is simple: collect all the diamonds to proceed to the next level, but beware of the opposing gravities between the two characters! Unlike most platformer games, Heaven and Hell is a game where both characters are controlled using the same keys; as a result, this poses a challenging twist on classic platformer games.

## Mechanics
* R - reset
* Space - jump
* Arrows -  move left & right
