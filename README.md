## Overview
A single player, 2D-platformer made with Python and pygame. The game’s objective is simple: collect all the diamonds to proceed to the next level, but beware of the opposing gravities between the two characters! Unlike most platformer games, **Heaven and Hell** has both characters controlled using the same keys, providing a challenging twist on classic platformer mechanics.

## Mechanics
 Key           | Action                                      |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| **R**        | Reset the level                             |
| **Space**    | Single or double jump to avoid obstacles    |
| **←    →**   | Move left or right to navigate characters   |
